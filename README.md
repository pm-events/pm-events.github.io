# How to contribute
1. Edit *only* **rumors.js** and **announced.js**.
2. **rumors.js** works for the ongoing page too, so add everything in there even if already in **announced.js**. Don't remove the events from the file until they actually expired.
3. The *name* property has to be an Array, even if it's only one event on the same date and expiration.
4. Dates must follow the **UTC Timezone**, so using the dates from the **#datamines** channel is the way (they are always in UTC).
5. In **announced.js** you will only add **date**, no **expires** since the ongoing page only works from the **rumors.js**, **date** can be *TBA*, since sometimes the announcements have no date.
6. For grid and EX icons, use \[grid] - \[ex] - \[gridEX], depending on what they have, eg. *Sygna Suit Red & Charizard\[gridEX] Pokéfair Scout*.
7. Follow this layout for the events list (announced.js only):
```
///// rumors.js
export const rumors = [{
name: ["Event Name 1", "Event Name 2", "..."],
date: "January 23, 2021",
expires: "March 1, 2022"
},
{
name: ["Event name"],
date: "February 1, 2021",
expires: "February 13, 2021"
}]


///// announced.js
export const announced = [{
name: ["Event Name"],
date: "TBA"
}]
```
For rumors.js, you will only need to copy-paste the list from the datamine server, which usually goes and must be like this:
```
///// rumors.js
export const rumors = `Event 1 Name

Event 1 Date
Event 1 Expiration

Event 2 Name

Event 2 Date
Event 2 Expiration

Event 3 Name[...]
`
```
